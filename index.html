    <p>Today is the first day of the rest of your life, grab the bull by the horns and go!</p>
    <p>If I could be anywhere, it would be the mountains.  That is where I feel most at peace with the world.
       When I'm not in the mountains or bull fighting, I live in Henrico, Virginia.  Henrico
       is a county that surrounds the state capital, Richmond.  I am originally from Western Massachusetts, did some time
       in New Jersey and Williamsburg, Virginia before landing in the Richmond area in 1990.
    </p>
    <p>One of my current hobbies is pursuing state high points.  Each state has a highest point, if only a rise on the side of the road.  
        Alaska boasts the highest, Denali/Mount McKinley at 20,146 ft above sea level.  Florida has the lowest highpoint at 345 ft.
      I have currently completed 29, with more on the calendar for this year.
     </p>
     <p>I have spent the entirety of my professional life in the software development arena.  I received my associate's degree with 
        a focus on programming and business at the time when personal computers were just making the scene.  I was fortunate to have
        the opportunity to by-pass mainframes and get in on the cutting edge technologies.  I started my career at the University of
        Massachusetts, and then went on to work in various industries including; insurance, mortgage banking, custom contract
        development, consulting and the pharmaceutical industry.  During that time, I returned to school to complete my Bachelor's
        degree in Information Systems at the University of Richmond.</p>
     <p>Coming full-circle, I have just recently taken a position in the Administrative Services department at my alma mater.  
         My first assignment required development in Oracle APEX (Application Express), a language I didn't know. I have spent
         the first four months learning the technology, and have my first project ready for deployment.  One thing I discovered
         is that I need a more in-depth understanding of the web development stack, particularly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
         To accomplish this, I have enrolled in an intensive 6-month boot camp.  I have been in and out of management positions,
         but found I prefer the hands on technical an analytical components of development.  I especially enjoy meeting with the
        business teams to understand how technology can solve some of their challenges.
